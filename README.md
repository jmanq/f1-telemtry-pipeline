This project builds a full end-to-end data pipeline for analyzing Formula 1 race sessions using FastF1, Databricks, and a Streamlit web app.
The pipeline ingests raw telemetry + lap data, processes it into analytical gold tables, and makes it explorable through an interactive app.

📸 Screenshots of the Streamlit app are included in the repository.
